# NDL Unpaid Carers Central Analyses

#### Project Status: In progress

# Project description 

This output describes how many carers were known to GPs and local authorities in six areas of England and Wales (Leeds, Liverpool, Wirral, North West London, Neath Port Talbot and Swansea).  

 

Due to differences in data availability, not all local authorities have the same study start and end dates. 

* Swansea: 01/04/2021 to 19/06/2022 (1 year) 

* Neath Port Talbot: 01/07/2017 to 26/06/2022 (5 years) 

* Liverpool: 01/01/2016 to 31/12/2021 (6 years) 

* Wirral: 01/01/2016 to 31/12/2021 (6 years) 

* Leeds: 01/01/2016 to 31/12/2021 (6 years) 

* North West London: 01/01/2016 to 31/12/2021 (6 years) 

 

We compared the number of carers identified in local GP and local authority datasets to the numbers reported in the 2021 Census. We found that: 

* data held by GPs and local authorities identified at most between 11% and 26% of unpaid carers compared to the 2021 Census 

* GP sources identified up to 15 times more carers than local authority sources 

* local authority data tended to identify more older carers than GP data 

* less than 7% of carers identified were found in both GP and local authority data.

# Data Sources  

This analysis relies on the 2021 Census and the following data sources, which have been accessed and linked by NDL partners. 

* _Local authority data:_ local authorities have a legal duty to provide an assessment of carer needs and to provide support (such as respite care or direct payments) to those who are deemed eligible. Local authorities, therefore, can identify some unpaid carers through their stored carer assessments and case management systems used to organize and deliver this support 

* _GP records:_ GPs are encouraged to use clinical codes to keep an electronic record of their patients who are unpaid carers. This is so they can support unpaid carers in taking care of their own health and the health of the person (or people) they are caring for. For example, some GP surgeries offer annual carer health checks, referrals to social prescribing schemes or priority appointments while others support carers with drawing up contingency plans. 

* _Hospital records_ 

* _Patient demographic databases_ 

We used a federated analytics model whereby analyses were carried out by each of the Networked Data Lab partners without any patient-level data leaving any of their research environments.  

The results presented in our report are based on data provided by patients/service users and collected by the NHS and local authorities as part of their care and support.  

 

# How it works 

**0. Combining data:** The purpose of this file is to append all analyses by NDL labs into one convenient data frame, to prepare the relevant tables from the 2021 Census to be merged with this data frame.  

**1. Local Analyses:** This file produces various charts and statistics used to explore the data, some of which are included in our final report.
